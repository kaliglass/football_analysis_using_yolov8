# Football Analysis using YOLOv8

This project performs football match analysis using YOLOv8 for object detection and video processing. The system detects and tracks players, referees, and the ball, then applies further analysis including team assignment, player tracking, movement estimation, and more.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to apply computer vision and machine learning techniques to football match videos. Using YOLOv8 for detection and additional modules for tracking and analysis, the system creates data and visual outputs that help analyze player movement and match dynamics. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
